# Falaya Playwright Automation (TypeScript)

This project implements two Playwright test cases for `https://falaya.com`:

1. `Falaya URL verification`
2. `Falaya mobile responsive`

## Project Structure

- `tests/`
  - `falaya-url-verification.spec.ts`
  - `falaya-mobile-responsive.spec.ts`
- `utils/`
  - `linkDiscovery.ts`
  - `reportWriter.ts`
- `reports/` (generated at runtime)
  - `discovered-urls.json`
  - `url-verification-report.json`
  - `url-verification-report.html`
  - `mobile-responsive-report.json`
  - `mobile-responsive-report.html`
  - `screenshots/mobile/*.png`
- `playwright.config.ts`
- `package.json`

## Install

```bash
npm i
npx playwright install
```

## Run

Run URL verification only:

```bash
npm run test:url
```

Run mobile responsive only:

```bash
npm run test:mobile
```

Run all tests:

```bash
npm test
```

Run tests with Allure report generation:

```bash
npm run test:allure
```

Generate Allure report from existing results:

```bash
npm run allure:generate
```

Open Allure report:

```bash
npm run allure:open
```

## Reports

Custom reports generated by tests:

- `reports/url-verification-report.json`
- `reports/url-verification-report.html`
- `reports/mobile-responsive-report.json`
- `reports/mobile-responsive-report.html`
- `reports/screenshots/mobile/*.png`
- `reports/discovered-urls.json`

Playwright built-in HTML report:

- `playwright-report/index.html`

Allure report:

- `allure-results/`
- `allure-report/index.html`

## Notes

- No hard waits are used; checks rely on Playwright auto-waiting and assertions.
- URL discovery is cached in `reports/discovered-urls.json` so mobile tests use the same URL set.
- Footer link checks are captured per visited page and included in the URL verification report.
